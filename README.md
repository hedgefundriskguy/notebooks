# python_notebooks
This repository contains several iPython Notebooks that demonstrate some ofthe types of analysis that I have done with Python as well as other technoloigies
iPython was chosen for demonstration processes only. I have also developed similar (and more advanced ) analytics in C# and Matlab.

1. HedgeFundTimeSeriesRiskAnalysis.ipynb - Analyis of hedge fund risk based on monthly time series.
2. EquityStrategyAnalysis.ipynb - Analysis of funds classfied as Equity Long/Short. This could be a starting point for doing quantiative classification of hedge funds based om their time series data.

4. RiskDashboard.ipynb - Monitor and analysis of risk limits of a trading portfolio
